    "##### Introduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "Climate transformations, such as rising temperatures, shifting precipitation patterns, and increasing extreme climatic events, are reshaping how landscape function and are influenced by human activities. While the impacts of climate change are global, they manifest differently across places due to varying environmental and cultural contexts. Climatic trends and impacts, shaped by specific cultural and environmental contexts, are understood and experienced differently by individuals and communities, carrying varied meanings over time. While science-based technologies with regional, long term data collection, and engineering are essential for characterizing climate change effects, they cannot fully capture the nuances and contingencies that emerge when these changes intersect with human lives. Many communities lack the required knowledge or technology to access this information which is directly influencing their everyday life.\n",
    "\n",
    "This data pipeline project is offering a space for me to exercise the process of data engineering as a landscape designer, to explore the integration of multiple datasets to visualize climate trend and pattern over time at selected areas of interest. Through collecting and visualizing historical climatic data, remote sensing data, and census data from open sources, the final dashboard aims to set up a site background profile and help communities to understand climate change and impact through accessible visual and communication at selected sites.\n",

    "\n",
    "    The authors emphasize that both natural and human-induced climate variability and change are having growing effects on both human and natural systems. To understand how the climate system functions, its past behavior, and potential future patterns, it is essential to rely on climate data, including instrumental and proxy observations, satellite records, and model outputs. Meanwhile, the amount, diversity, and complexity of climate data are exploding, as is the demand for this data from a wide range of users, from researchers and resource managers to the general public. Therefore, the challenge of accessing, understanding, formatting, and contextualizing climate data for non-experts becomes more obvious. The authors addresses the need for a more open, user-friendly data access paradigm. \n",

    "    This paper presents the design and implementation of the Hawai'i Climate Data Portal which is a web-based platform for the automation, visualization, and dissemination of climatological data, focusing primarily on precipitation. Although using a more complex and advanced data engineering process, the research validated a rigorous data visual is highly useful for resource planning, preparation, as well as stakeholder engagement. The system automates the daily collection, processing of climate data, and quality control from multiple sensor networks and repositories, producing high-resolution gridded maps of rainfall and temperature. This example demonstrates and gives insight on the possibility of translating collected climate data to a spatially mapped interface for future interpretation. \n",

    "    This article demonstrated method of acquiring historical climate data for defined location and timespan, specifically using the NOAA Climate API. With an article previously describing method using the NOAA API for accessing historical weather from the National Centers for Environmental Information by the same author, this new article articulates steps to code using the API, as well as listing available climate data. He also shared in the article challenges in acquiring the data with defined location and how to tackle the issue. The walk through of key datasets, updated endpoints, and Python implementation details from this article is very helpful in giving insights for the project.\n",

    "    NCDC's Climate Data Online offers web services that provide access to current climate data. Developers can use the database of weather and climate data with their own scripts or programs. An access token is required to use the API, and each token will be limited to five requests per second and 10,000 requests per day. (Introduction from webpage)\n",

    "    This is an open-source weather API and offers free access for non-commercial use. No API key required. It partners with national weather services and provide high resolution open data, ranging from 1 to 11 km. It's a JSON API. Some datasets are in global scale. (Introduction from webpage)\n",

    "    This is a set of RESTful APIs that provide access to various satellite imagery archives. It allows users to access raw satellite data, rendered images, statistical analysis, and other features. The Sentinel Hub has the ability to automatically archive, process in real-time, and distribute remote sensing data and related Earth Observation products. Users can retrieve satellite data and process it for specific area of interest and time range utilizing APIs. (Introduction from webpage)\n",

    "\n",
    "    These are all the publicly available datasets of census data provided by the US Census Bureau. Data can be accessed in html, xml, and json formats. Many available datasets such as economic census, population estimates and projections, geography information, and poverty statistics are useful to analyze demographic and socio-economic status of a place.\n",

    "##### Data:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Potential Analyses:\n",
    "Most of the data sources listed above include a time parameter that historical data can be extracted, engineered, and visualize. They feature climate patterns over time such as temperature, precipitation, wind direction, snow depth changes, etc. To visualize climate trend at area of interest on a public-facing dashboard, analyses can be histograms or line charts showing statistic over time. Extracted demographic and socio-economic contexts from census data can be shown as cross-tabs with featuring climate data to show correlation of climate change and community impacts.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Challenges:\n",
    "Datasets listed above are from sources openly accessible which could make it easier to use the data for the project. Aiming to correlated multiple datasets from different sources, one big challenge would be the engineering process to synthesize or merge them. Since they are collected in different methods with distinct parameters, it would be harder to combine them to visualize. NOAA provides high quality data but it's limitation on data/API usage could be a challenge. Only selective amount of data can be used. Meanwhile the data engineering process of translating the statistical data to visual communication through coding is generally a big challenge to me, who has not much experience on data science processes. Being trained to be visual-oriented, I hope to create a georeferenced outcome which include some sort of spatial quality on the dashboard. With limited knowledge on data engineering, an alternative plan would be a simplified version of climate data visualization.\n",
