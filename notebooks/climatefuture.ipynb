    "\n",
    "##### Introduction:\n",
    "\n",
    "Climate transformations, such as rising temperatures, shifting precipitation patterns, and increasing extreme climatic events, are reshaping how landscape function and are influenced by human activities. While the impacts of climate change are global, they manifest differently across places due to varying environmental and cultural contexts. Climatic trends and impacts, shaped by specific cultural and environmental contexts, are understood and experienced differently by individuals and communities, carrying varied meanings over time. While science-based technologies with regional, long term data collection, and engineering are essential for characterizing climate change effects, they cannot fully capture the nuances and contingencies that emerge when these changes intersect with human lives. Many communities lack the required knowledge or technology to access this information which is directly influencing their everyday life.\n",
    "\n",
    "This data pipeline project is offering a space for me to exercise the process of data engineering as a landscape designer, to explore the integration of multiple datasets to visualize climate trend and pattern over time at selected areas of interest. Through collecting and visualizing historical climatic data, remote sensing data, and census data from open sources, the final dashboard aims to set up a site background profile and help communities to understand climate change and impact through accessible visual and communication at selected sites.\n",

    "\n",
    "    The authors emphasize that both natural and human-induced climate variability and change are having growing effects on both human and natural systems. To understand how the climate system functions, its past behavior, and potential future patterns, it is essential to rely on climate data, including instrumental and proxy observations, satellite records, and model outputs. Meanwhile, the amount, diversity, and complexity of climate data are exploding, as is the demand for this data from a wide range of users, from researchers and resource managers to the general public. Therefore, the challenge of accessing, understanding, formatting, and contextualizing climate data for non-experts becomes more obvious. The authors addresses the need for a more open, user-friendly data access paradigm. \n",

    "    This paper presents the design and implementation of the Hawai'i Climate Data Portal which is a web-based platform for the automation, visualization, and dissemination of climatological data, focusing primarily on precipitation. Although using a more complex and advanced data engineering process, the research validated a rigorous data visual is highly useful for resource planning, preparation, as well as stakeholder engagement. The system automates the daily collection, processing of climate data, and quality control from multiple sensor networks and repositories, producing high-resolution gridded maps of rainfall and temperature. This example demonstrates and gives insight on the possibility of translating collected climate data to a spatially mapped interface for future interpretation. \n",

    "    This article demonstrated method of acquiring historical climate data for defined location and timespan, specifically using the NOAA Climate API. With an article previously describing method using the NOAA API for accessing historical weather from the National Centers for Environmental Information by the same author, this new article articulates steps to code using the API, as well as listing available climate data. He also shared in the article challenges in acquiring the data with defined location and how to tackle the issue. The walk through of key datasets, updated endpoints, and Python implementation details from this article is very helpful in giving insights for the project.\n",

    "    This API provides access to climate data from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Climate change is not a phenomenon that affects all regions equally. While some areas might experience more frequent and intense rainfall, others are confronted with extended periods of drought, which can have severe impact on agriculture. The change in temperature patterns is also unevenly distributed, with cities being particularly vulnerable to heatwaves. The API provides daily climate data rather than climate indices for more granular detail of changes. The data provides CSV file as well as API URL.

    "##### Potential Analyses:\n",
    "Most of the data sources listed above include a time parameter that historical data can be extracted, engineered, and visualize. They feature climate patterns over time such as temperature, precipitation, wind direction, snow depth changes, etc. To visualize climate trend at area of interest on a public-facing dashboard, analyses can be histograms or line charts showing statistic over time. Extracted demographic and socio-economic contexts from census data can be shown as cross-tabs with featuring climate data to show correlation of climate change and community impacts.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Challenges:\n",
    "Datasets listed above are from sources openly accessible which could make it easier to use the data for the project. Aiming to correlated multiple datasets from different sources, one big challenge would be the engineering process to synthesize or merge them. Since they are collected in different methods with distinct parameters, it would be harder to combine them to visualize. NOAA provides high quality data but it's limitation on data/API usage could be a challenge. Only selective amount of data can be used. Meanwhile the data engineering process of translating the statistical data to visual communication through coding is generally a big challenge to me, who has not much experience on data science processes. Being trained to be visual-oriented, I hope to create a georeferenced outcome which include some sort of spatial quality on the dashboard. With limited knowledge on data engineering, an alternative plan would be a simplified version of climate data visualization.\n",
